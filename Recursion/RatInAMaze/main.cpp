/*
 * You are given an integer N and a grid of size NxN.
 * The cells of the grid are numbered row wise from 1 to N^2. Rat wants to
 * travel from cell number 1 to cell number N^2, and it can move in only right
 * direction or down direction from a particular cell. There is exactly one path
 * from source to destination as some cells are blocked. Help the rap to find
 * the path.
 *
 * Input Format:
 *
 *   In the function an integer N is given, and a 2D vector consisting of only
 *   'O's and 'X's is given where 'X' represents blocked cell.
 *
 * Output Format:
 *
 *   Return a vector of cell numbers of cells in path (in sequence).
 *
 * Sample Testcase:
 *
 *   Input:
 *
 *   4
 *   O O X O
 *   O X O O
 *   O O O X
 *   X X O O
 *
 *   Output:
 *
 *   1 5 9 10 11 15 16
